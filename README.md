# FOLDER CONTENTS: 

  # TRec_EI_Preproc.m -> original preprocessing script. Takes in both tic onset and offset codes. 
        # File is organized such that you can use command + F to search for 'UPDATE' which will show all places in the script that must be updated for subj-specific data . 

  # TReC_EI_Preproc_Final.m -> Current working preprocessing code. Takes in ONLY onset markers. Offset markers are estimated based on amplitude thresholding. 
        # File is similarly organized, you can search for 'UPDATE' to see blocks where subj-specific data is required
